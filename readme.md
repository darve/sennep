Twitter Bookmarks is a little website/web app that lets you sign into your Twitter account and load your favourited tweets into a list. You can then drag and drop the tweets around to change the order. 

We have divided the brief into different features. You don’t have to include all features. Please pick what you feel most comfortable with and what you can manage in time. It’s important to us that the end result feels finished, tested and is written in clean code. Please follow the design closely. 

#### Features: 

- Connect twitter handle, pull favourites from Twitter account using Twitter API
- Load your favourited tweets into a list (limited to the last 25 favourited tweets)
- Ability to drag & drop the tweets to custom order
- Update favourited tweets with refresh button

- Any trendy animations or usability tweaks you can think of
- Optimise for iPhone and/or desktop

1. Automatically save the custom order (use local storage, keep it simple)
2. Login user automatically after first login
