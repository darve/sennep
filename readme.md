## Brioche

Brioche is a super barebones boilerplate that uses SASS, GULP, and EXPRESS.

Once you have run <code>npm install</code> and correctly installed all of the dependencies, running <code>node app</code> from the root will launch an express server that serves up static files from the <code>app</code> directory.

Running <code>gulp watch</code> will monitor changes to the SCSS and JS files and compile / lint them accordingly.

Running <code> gulp build</code> will lint, compile and minify all of your scss and javascript, and then put everything into a directory called <code>prod</code>.
